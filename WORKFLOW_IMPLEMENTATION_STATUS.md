# RAVEN Workflow Implementation Status

## Overview
The RAVEN workflow driver (`raven_workflow_driver.py`) has been implemented according to the documented workflow approaches. The driver supports two approaches:

1. **Approach A**: Fast routing product workflow (2-3 minutes) - requires pre-existing routing products
2. **Approach B**: Full delineation workflow (15-30 minutes) - creates models from scratch using real DEM data

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed
1. **Main Driver Script** (`raven_workflow_driver.py`)
   - Command-line interface with argparse
   - Support for both approaches (A, B, auto)
   - Proper logging and error handling
   - Results summary output

2. **Workflow Steps Library** (`workflows/steps/`)
   - Base step class with consistent interface
   - All step modules implemented:
     - `validation_steps.py`
     - `routing_product_steps.py`
     - `dem_processing_steps.py`
     - `watershed_steps.py`
     - `lake_processing_steps.py`
     - `hru_generation_steps.py`
     - `raven_generation_steps.py`

3. **Workflow Approaches** (`workflows/approaches/`)
   - `routing_product_workflow.py` (Approach A)
   - `full_delineation_workflow.py` (Approach B)

4. **Real Data Integration**
   - DEM download from USGS 3DEP (confirmed working)
   - WhiteboxTools integration for DEM conditioning
   - No mock/synthetic data used (as per CLAUDE.md requirements)

### ⚠️ Limitations

1. **Approach A (Routing Product)**
   - Requires pre-existing BasinMaker routing products
   - These are not currently available in the expected locations
   - Would need actual routing product data to function

2. **Approach B (Full Delineation)**
   - DEM download and conditioning working with real data
   - Some steps still contain simplified implementations
   - Full watershed delineation requires complete WhiteboxTools pipeline

## Testing Results

### Successful Tests
- ✅ Real DEM download from USGS 3DEP
- ✅ DEM conditioning with WhiteboxTools (fill, flow direction, flow accumulation)
- ✅ Command-line interface and argument parsing
- ✅ Logging and error handling

### Current Issues
- Approach A requires routing product data files that don't exist
- Some workflow steps need full implementation for production use
- PROJ/GDAL environment conflicts (resolved by cleaning environment variables)

## Usage Examples

### Test Approach B (Full Delineation)
```bash
python raven_workflow_driver.py --approach B --lat 45.5017 --lon -73.5673 --project "Montreal_Test"
```

### Auto-select Best Approach
```bash
python raven_workflow_driver.py --lat 45.5017 --lon -73.5673 --project "Montreal_Auto"
```

## Next Steps for Production

1. **For Approach A**: Obtain or generate BasinMaker routing products
2. **For Approach B**: Complete implementation of all processing steps
3. **Testing**: Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
4. **Documentation**: Generate API documentation for all modules

## Key Design Decisions

1. **No Mock Data**: Following CLAUDE.md requirements, all data comes from real sources
2. **Modular Architecture**: Each step is independent and reusable
3. **Consistent Interface**: All steps follow the same base class pattern
4. **Real Data Sources**: USGS 3DEP for DEMs, Environment Canada for climate data
5. **Professional Tools**: WhiteboxTools for geospatial processing
